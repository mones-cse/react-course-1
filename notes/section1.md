#### 4. Real-World SPAs & React Web Apps

#### 5. Writing our First React Code 1
- React and reactDOM are different
- React is all about components. ReactDOM is about rendering these components to the real DOM.
- Babel is simply a tool which compiles the next generation Javascript code to the js code that browser can understand
- React component is just a function.
- React DOM is actually exposes an object, it has a render method,which allows us to render a Javascript function as a
  component to the real DOM.
- class actually is a keyword in Javascript, so we need to use `className` instead of `class`.
- To make component configure dynamically we need to pass argument to the function which we call props.
- JSX has the requirement of only having one root element, so adjacent elements are not allowed.

#### 6. Why Should we Choose React?

- strong community
- focus on business logic
- ui state handle become easier

#### 7. React Alternatives

- angular
- vue

#### 8. Understanding Single Page Applications (SPA) and Multi Page Applications (MPA)

- In SPA application,we only get back one single HTML file from the server
- IN MPA we get back multiple HTML pages where each page has the content for a given route;
- On multi-page applications, we might also use React, but only to create little widgets,
- we only need one ReactDOM.render call because we only have one root app component which is mounted to the DOM and
  which hosts all other React components.
